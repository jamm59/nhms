              Flowbite is an open-source library of UI components built with the
              utility-first classes from Tailwind CSS. It also includes
              interactive elements such as dropdowns, modals, datepickers.

              Before going digital, you might benefit from scribbling down some
              ideas in a sketchbook. This way, you can think things through
              before committing to an actual design project.
            </p>
            <p>
              But then I found a{" "}
              <a href="https://flowbite.com">
                component library based on Tailwind CSS called Flowbite
              </a>
              . It comes with the most commonly used UI components, such as
              buttons, navigation bars, cards, form elements, and more which are
              conveniently built with the utility classes from Tailwind CSS.

            <h2>Getting started with Flowbite</h2>
            <p>
              First of all you need to understand how Flowbite works. This
              library is not another framework. Rather, it is a set of
              components based on Tailwind CSS that you can just copy-paste from
              the documentation.
            </p>
            <p>
              It also includes a JavaScript file that enables interactive
              components, such as modals, dropdowns, and datepickers which you
              can optionally include into your project via CDN or NPM.
