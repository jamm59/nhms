#### README Template for Prisma with PostgreSQL

##### Introduction

Welcome to the README file for the Prisma configuration with PostgreSQL in your project. This README will provide an overview of the Prisma setup, directory structure, and instructions on how to use Prisma with PostgreSQL.

##### Prisma Setup

[Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) is an open-source database toolkit that provides an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) layer for your application. It allows you to define your database schema using the Prisma Schema Language and provides a powerful set of APIs for database operations.

To get started with Prisma and PostgreSQL, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Node.js: You can download and install Node.js from the official website: [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).

- Prisma CLI: Install the Prisma Command Line Interface (CLI) globally by running the following command:

  ```shell
  npm install -g prisma
  ```

- PostgreSQL: Install PostgreSQL and make sure it's running on your machine. You can download PostgreSQL from the official website: [postgresql.org](https://www.postgresql.org).

##### Directory Structure

The Prisma configuration and schema files are typically placed in a specific directory within your project. Here is an example of how the directory structure might look:

```
prisma/
├── migrations/
└── schema.prisma
```

- **migrations**: This folder contains the database migration files generated by Prisma when you make changes to your database schema.

- **schema.prisma**: This file is the main configuration file for Prisma. It defines your database schema using the Prisma Schema Language.

##### Prisma Schema

The `schema.prisma` file is where you define your database schema using the Prisma Schema Language. It allows you to define your data models, relationships, and other database configurations. Here is an example of how a `schema.prisma` file might look for a PostgreSQL database:

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

model User {
  id       Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  email    String   @unique
  name     String?
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt DateTime @updatedAt
}
```

In this example, we define a `User` model with various fields such as `id`, `email`, `name`, `createdAt`, and `updatedAt`.

##### Prisma Client

Prisma generates a Prisma Client based on your `schema.prisma` file. The Prisma Client provides a type-safe and auto-completing API for database operations. You can import and use the Prisma Client in your application code. Here is an example of how to use the Prisma Client to perform CRUD operations:

```javascript
const { PrismaClient } = require("@prisma/client");

const prisma = new PrismaClient();

async function createUser(data) {
  const user = await prisma.user.create({ data });
  return user;
}

async function getUsers() {
  const users = await prisma.user.findMany();
  return users;
}

// Usage example
async function main() {
  const newUser = await createUser({
    email: "test@example.com",
    name: "John Doe",
  });
  console.log("Created user:", newUser);

  const allUsers = await getUsers();
  console.log("All users:", allUsers);
}

main()
  .catch((e) => console.error(e))
  .finally(async () => {
    await prisma.$disconnect();
  });
```

##### Database Migrations

Prisma allows you to perform database migrations to manage changes to your database schema over time. Migrations help you keep your database in sync with your schema. Prisma automatically generates migration files for you based on the changes you make to your `schema.prisma` file. You can apply these migrations using the Prisma CLI.

To create a new migration, run the following command:

```shell
npx prisma migrate dev --name <migration-name>
```

To apply pending migrations, run the following command:

```shell
npx prisma migrate deploy
```

To generate Prisma Client based on your schema and the applied migrations, run the following command:

```shell
npx prisma generate
```

##### Additional Configuration

You can configure additional options for your Prisma setup, such as database connection details, in the `schema.prisma` file. Refer to the Prisma documentation for more information on advanced configuration options.
