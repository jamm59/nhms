#### README Template - Start Here

##### Introduction

Welcome to the README file for the "Start Here" guide in your project. This guide is designed to help new developers navigate the codebase and find relevant documentation. It provides an overview of the project structure and key resources to get started.

##### Project Structure

Understanding the project structure is essential for navigating the codebase effectively. Here is a high-level overview of the project structure:

- **src**: This folder contains the source code of the project. It includes subfolders for different modules or components.

- **public**: This folder contains static assets that are publicly accessible.

- **config**: This folder contains configuration files or environment variables used in the project.

- **docs**: This folder contains documentation and guides related to the project.

- **tests**: This folder contains unit tests or integration tests for the project.

- **scripts**: This folder contains scripts or utilities that can be used for development or deployment.

##### Navigating the Codebase

To get started with the codebase, follow these steps:

1. Start by exploring the `src` folder. This is where the main code resides. Look for subfolders that represent different modules, features, or components of the project.

2. Open the relevant files within each subfolder to understand the implementation details. Take note of any entry points or main files that serve as starting points for different parts of the application.

3. Pay attention to the file and folder naming conventions used in the project. Consistent naming conventions can provide hints about the purpose or functionality of different files.

4. Look for any documentation comments within the code. These comments often provide additional information about the code or explain its purpose.

##### Finding Documentation

Documentation is crucial for understanding the project and its dependencies. Here are some key resources to find documentation:

- **README files**: Start with the README files in the project root and subdirectories. These files often provide high-level information about the project, setup instructions, and guidelines.

- **Code comments**: Look for comments within the codebase that provide explanations or references to relevant documentation.

- **Documentation folder**: Check the `docs` folder for any additional guides, architecture diagrams, or usage examples.

- **External dependencies**: If the project utilizes external libraries or frameworks, visit their official websites or GitHub repositories for detailed documentation and API references.

- **Code version control**: Utilize the version control system (e.g., Git) to explore the commit history and view any associated documentation or discussions.

##### Contributing and Support

If you have any questions or need assistance, don't hesitate to reach out to the project's support channels. Here are some ways to get help:

- **Community forums**: Check if the project has a community forum or discussion group where you can ask questions or get support from other developers.

- **Issue tracker**: Visit the project's issue tracker or bug tracker on platforms like GitHub. Search for existing issues or create a new one if you encounter any problems.

- **Contributing guidelines**: If you're interested in contributing to the project, consult the project's contributing guidelines for instructions on how to submit bug reports, feature requests, or code contributions.

- **Contact project maintainers**: Look for contact information of the project maintainers in the README or the project's website. Reach out to them directly if you need specific help or have questions.
