#### README Template for JSX Components

##### Introduction

Welcome to the README file for the JSX components in your project. This README will provide an overview of the different components and their functionality, as well as instructions on how to use them in your project.

##### Components

The components in your project are implemented using JSX, a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code within your JavaScript files. Here are some of the key components included in your project:

- **Login Component**: The Login component is responsible for rendering a login form and handling user authentication. It can be found in the `Login.js` file. Here is an example of how to use the Login component:

  ```jsx
  import React from "react";
  import Login from "./Login";

  function App() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Welcome to My App!</h1>
        <Login />
      </div>
    );
  }

  export default App;
  ```

- **Register Component**: The Register component is responsible for rendering a registration form and handling user registration. It can be found in the `Register.js` file. Here is an example of how to use the Register component:

  ```jsx
  import React from "react";
  import Register from "./Register";

  function App() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Welcome to My App!</h1>
        <Register />
      </div>
    );
  }

  export default App;
  ```

- **User Component**: The User component is responsible for displaying user information. It can be found in the `User.js` file. Here is an example of how to use the User component:

  ```jsx
  import React from "react";
  import User from "./User";

  function App() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Welcome to My App!</h1>
        <User name="John Doe" age={25} />
      </div>
    );
  }

  export default App;
  ```

##### File Structure

The components are typically organized in a folder structure that reflects their hierarchy and relationship. Here is an example of how the components folder structure might look:

```
components/
├── Login.js
├── Register.js
├── User.js
└── utils/
    ├── Form.js
    └── Button.js
```

In this example, the main components are at the root level, while utility components are placed in a separate `utils` folder.

##### Component Dependencies

Some components may have dependencies on other components or external libraries. Make sure to check the documentation or comments within the component files to understand any necessary dependencies.
